# CNN-augmented-FMI-log-inerp
This repository contains the codes used to research FMI log augmented interpretation using CNNs
this repository contains 4 .py files used to convert the log into training images that can be used to train a classifier. the method of converting the log into format that can be read by the files is fully described in the "code_user_manual.pdf" which as the name implied is a manual for this purpose.
the transfer learning and network trainig code is in the form of 2 .ipynb note books that are readable by google colab. the actual pre-trained network used to deliver the result of the paper is also available in a folder named "pre-trained network".
